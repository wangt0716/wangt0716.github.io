<h2>Semi-supervised Deep Active Learning</h2>
Abstract: Most classical active learning algorithms only use labeled data to train a task model. Our investigation shows that ample unlabeled data can 
	arguably provide rich and useful information for the task model training. In this project, we aim to design novel schemes to properly involve 
	unlabeled data in training the task model, while the schemes are also expected to serve as new metrics for estimating the uncertainty of 
	unlabeled data.

<h2>Interpretable Active Learning</h2>
Abstract: The ultimate goal of active learning is to train a powerful task model with a certain number of newly annotated data. The capability of the
	task model should be evaluated by its testing performance. Thus, a question can be naturally raised: how an individual annotated data sample will 
	impact the final testing performance. In this project, we aim to investigate and interpret such an impact, which can inversely provide a guidance 
	for unlabeled data selection.

<h2>Relations between Machine Learning Fashions</h2>
Abstract: In this project, we aim to explore the relations between various machine learning fashions. For instance, how active learning relates to 
	curriculum learning, and whether one can improve the other. We expect such a study to foster a deep understanding of various learning fashions, 
	eventually benefiting the development of robust machine learning pipelines.

<h2>Data Aspect AI</h2>
Abstract: Most existing AI research focuses on model aspect (e.g. designing novel networks or training schemes). Data aspect AI is an emerging and promising 
	research area, gaining tremendous attention from both academia and industry. In this project, we aim to propose and leverage novel data aspect AI
	solutions to boost biomedical data analytics.

<h2>Modeling Rankings in Recommendation Systems</h2>
 Abstract: Modeling ranked data is an essential component in a number of important applications including recommendation systems and web-search. In many cases, judges omit preference among unobserved items and between unobserved and observed items. This case of analyzing incomplete rankings is very important from a practical perspective and yet has not been fully studied due to considerable computational difficulties. We show how to avoid such computational difficulties and efficiently construct a non-parametric model for rankings with missing items. We demonstrate our approach and show how it applies to real world data in the context of collaborative filtering.

<h2>Visualizing Search Algorithm Dissimilarites</h2>
Abstract: We introduce a new dissimilarity function for ranked lists, the expected weighted Hoeffding distance, that has several advantages over current dissimilarity measures for partial rankings: it is (i) symmetric, (ii) interpretable with respect to search algorithms retrieving ranked lists of different lengths, (iii) flexible enough to model the increased attention users pay to top ranks over bottom ranks, (iv) computationally efficient, and (v) aggregate information over multiple queries in a meaningful way. We then use the measure with multi-dimensional scaling to visualize and explore relationships between the different search engines. Such visualization is highly effective for obtaining insights on which search engines to use, what search strategies users can employ, and how search results evolve over time.

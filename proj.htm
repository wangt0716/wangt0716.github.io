<h2>Semi-supervised Deep Active Learning</h2>
Abstract: Most classical active learning algorithms only use labeled data to train a task model. Our investigation shows that ample unlabeled data can 
	arguably provide rich and useful information for the task model training. In this project, we aim to design novel schemes to properly involve 
	unlabeled data in training the task model, while the schemes are also expected to serve as new metrics for estimating the uncertainty of 
	unlabeled data.

<h2>Interpretable Active Learning</h2>
Abstract: The ultimate goal of active learning is to train a powerful task model with a certain number of newly annotated data. The capability of the
	task model should be evaluated by its testing performance. Thus, a question can be naturally raised: how an individual annotated data sample will 
	impact the final testing performance. In this project, we aim to investigate and interpret such an impact, which can inversely provide a guidance 
	for unlabeled data selection.

<h2>Relations between Machine Learning Fashions</h2>
Abstract: In this project, we aim to explore the relations between various machine learning fashions. For instance, how active learning relates to 
	curriculum learning, and whether one can improve the other. We expect such a study to foster a deep understanding of various learning fashions, 
	eventually benefiting the development of robust machine learning pipelines.

<h2>Data Aspect AI</h2>
Abstract: Most existing AI research focuses on model aspect (e.g. designing novel networks or training schemes). Data aspect AI is an emerging and promising 
	research area, gaining tremendous attention from both academia and industry. In this project, we aim to propose and leverage novel data aspect AI
	solutions to boost biomedical data analytics.

<h2>Automated Science</h2>
 Abstract: Automated science is an emerging brand-new research area. In this project, we aim to develop a reliable platform to help biologists optimize 
	their experimental designs. The core of automated science is active machine learning, and we leverage our advantages on active learning research 
	to explore this new area.

<h2>Cryo-electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) Analysis with Machine Learning</h2>
Abstract: Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) is an emerging 3D imaging technique which shows great potentials in structural biology research. 
	In this project, we aim to develop novel machine learning algorithms to address the challenges in Cryo-ET analysis, such as semantic 
	segmentation and denoising.
